# Grym

An implementation of the generalized yeild model in R.

## Installing

The package is easily installed from GitHub, using the devtools package. 

```R
remotes::install_github("AustralianAntarcticDivision/Grym")
```

If you don't have `remotes` installed already, install it first. 

```R
install.packages("remotes")
```

Grym does not otherwise require remotes for normal use.
