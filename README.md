# Grym

An implementation of the generalized yeild model in R.

## Installing

The package is easily installed from GitHub, using the devtools package.

``` r
Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS="true")
remotes::install_github("AustralianAntarcticDivision/Grym", dependencies=TRUE)
```

If you donâ€™t have `remotes` installed already, install it first.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

Grym does not otherwise require remotes for normal use.
