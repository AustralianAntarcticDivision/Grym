# Grym

An implementation of the generalized yeild model in R. This
implementation is still considered a work in progress up until the paper
of comparisons has been submitted to WG-SAM-2020.

Once accepted by CCAMLR the accepted version of the Grym Package will be
hosted as a fork on the CCAMLR github account.

## Installing

The package is easily installed from GitHub, using the remotes package.

``` r
remotes::install_github("AustralianAntarcticDivision/Grym")
```

If you donâ€™t have `remotes` installed already, install it first.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

Grym does not otherwise require `remotes` for normal use.

## TODO

  - Parametric bootstrap from a vector of recruits

  - Check examples for consistency of implementation

  - Build GrymExamples

The goal of Grym is to have provide an R based implementation of the
Generalised Yield Model @GYM96

## Example

Grym is accompanied by the GrymExamples package which provides examples
of implementation for a number of species within the CCAMLR region.
